- **To Replicate the results using the above code or to use the model.**
1. Make a copy of the ipynb collab file to your own google drive.
2. Upload the train(msr_paraphrase_test.txt) and test dataset(msr_paraphrase_train.txt) to your own drive,  
use their paths in the code like  
train_filename = "drive/MyDrive/MSRParaphraseCorpus/msr_paraphrase_train.txt"  
test_filename = "drive/MyDrive/MSRParaphraseCorpus/msr_paraphrase_test.txt"
3. Run the code as Required.
